# cursor-startup

These are the startup files I use in my cursor environment.

## docs/

- `Design.md` : I use Sonnet to create a design document that I place here
- `notes.md` : the cursor rules spell out what and how to store project related memories i nthe notes file.
- `task_list.md` : this is the task list that I have cursor process the design, create an implementation plan and then create a `task_list.md`.  This helps kep the AI on track.

## .cursorrules

This is depercated, but it stil works.  These rules tell the AI how to use the `Design.md`, `notes.md` and `task_list.md`

## .cursor/

- `mcp.json` : this is project realated tools, I keep the file-system mcp tool here so I can set its permissions to only the project directory.
